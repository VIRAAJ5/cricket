            <h1> My Favourite Hobby <br> <span id="heading"> Cricket </span> </h1>
            <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.

My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home.At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.

Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. I use my right hand to hold the bat & bowl the ball which many people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. I was identified as the best bowler of the  School (my school) at the age of 14 which was a great achievement for me and my parents
